# Pick_N_Place_Bot_CEER
This is a simple project of Engineering Exploration Course, designed by my university's Center for Engineering Education Research.
This course project taught me the importance and role played by different engineers from different branches while building a project or finding a solution for a problem. This project was included in our curriculum so that we know the importance of interdisciplinary ascpect of engineering solutions. 
In this project we have designed and implemented a simple Pick and Place Robot with SCARA configuration.
